avrdmx is an implementation of multi-universe DMX output using Atmel AVR
microcontrollers. It's able to output up to 4 universes of DMX simultaneously
from a single device, without using hardware UARTs - this reduces hardware
complexity and cost. This project consists of a driver program that runs on a
host computer, firmware that runs on a board containing an Atmel AVR
microcontroller, and hardware containing RS-485 driver chips for sending data
to DMX receivers.

driver/ contains the Python driver program.  It receives streaming ACN packets
via UDP, and sends channel data to an Atmel AVR board attached via USB (using
USB CDC serial port emulation).

firmware/ contains an Atmel AVR program designed to run on a Teensy++ 2.0 board
(based on the AT90USB1286).

leonardo_firmware/ contains an Atmel AVR program designed to run on an Arduino
Leonardo (based on the ATmega32u4). It's based on LUFA
(http://www.fourwalledcubicle.com/LUFA.php).

Both firmware programs receive and buffer channel data from the driver program,
and output multiple universes of DMX to physical pins.

pcb/ contains an Eagle CAD design for an Arduino shield that uses RS-485 driver
chips to drive DMX receivers. It's intended to be used in conjunction with the
leonardo_firmware.
